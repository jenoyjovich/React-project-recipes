2. onion
3. Parsley
4. Garlic","Soak your dried chickpeas. Overnight or for at least 8-12 hours. Note that the chickpeas will triple in size, so cover them with plenty of water. Then drain and rinse them.

Shape your falafel. You can do this by hand, with a cookie scoop (which is what I use) or a falafel scoop. Decide if you’d like round balls or flatter patty shapes. The flatter shapes are better if you plan to pan fry or bake. Any shape can be used for deep frying. Form all your falafel and place on a plate.",https://i2.wp.com/www.downshiftology.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Falafel-10.jpg,790399,5f84778252de3d2898c76e11,0
